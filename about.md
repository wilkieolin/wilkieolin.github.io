**About Me**

I received my BS in Microelectronic Engineering and MS in Materials Science & Engineering from RIT in 2015. After that, I went on to complete my PhD in Nanoengineering at the SUNY Polytechnic Institute in 2019. 

My research focuses on developing next-generation computing systems which leverage new materials, devices, and dynamics. In particular, I focus on how biological computation can be used to inspire these systems and make artificial intelligence more efficient and effective. 

**About this Blog**

The goal of this research blog is to provide highlights into my research and areas of interest which are more approachable and interactive than traditional scientific papers.
